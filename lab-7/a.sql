-- Q5 determines the total capacity of the warehouses belonging 
-- to suppliers from a given nation in every
-- region. The suppliersâ€™ nation is a parameter stored 
-- in the file input/5.in. If there are no warehouses
-- in a region, then value 0 is printed for that region. 
-- Q5 prints the region and the capacity sorted
-- alphabetically by region. (3 points)
